      "desc": ["At a meeting in March 1956, senior government and church officials reached two conclusions regarding the future of education at Baker Lake: 1. Although a rudimentary day school education had been available through the Anglican and Catholic Missions for some time, a federal day school would be opened at Baker Lake as soon as possible. 2. With the recent opening of Turquetil Hall, the Roman Catholic residence at Chesterfield Inlet, a comparable facility for Anglican children was required in the Eastern Arctic. Because of its central location, and because it was predominantly Anglican, Baker Lake was selected as the probable location for the proposed residence. The Minutes from that meeting also note that seven buildings formerly used by the Department of Transport had been made available for “school purposes”, that a structural engineer had confirmed that at least three of them could be moved from their location about a mile outside Baker Lake into the community, and that “funds have been provided in the current year’s Estimates for doing some renovation of these buildings.” ", "Correspondence from September 1956 states that the first attempt to move the three buildings had resulted in substantial damage to one of them. However, a construction crew was working “vigorously” to repair the damaged building and to facilitate moving all three buildings to the settlement. Government officials remained “confident that the buildings will be quite suitable for their proposed purpose at Baker Lake.” ", "Correspondence from September and October 1956 states that to circumvent the delayed arrival of the Department of Transport buildings, the Anglican Canon at Baker Lake would teach “part time school until the school is ready and the teacher arrives”. Although the building renovations were complete, the work crew was waiting for the lake to freeze to sufficient depth to permit sledging the buildings to the community site. [BLS-000716]  A Memorandum notes that arrangements to provide lunches for pupils attending the temporary school would be made by the local Northern Service Officer. "],

", "In reference to hostel construction at Baker Lake, Minutes from a meeting of government and church officials in May 1957 state that “the Committee discussed at some length the question of the need for hostel accommodation in the Keewatin District and in the Cambridge Bay and Coppermine areas. The opinion was expressed that Baker Lake was really the most central point for the entire region and that a hostel there could serve children from Cambridge Bay and Coppermine as well as from Keewatin. It was also pointed out that the cost of operating a hostel at Baker Lake would be about one third the cost of a similar establishment at Cambridge Bay. The Committee agreed that Baker Lake was the most suitable location for a school hostel to serve the Keewatin District.” ", "Senior public servants, noting the extreme isolation of Baker Lake, particularly during winter months because of fierce and unpredictable weather conditions, recommended that the government approach hostel construction at Baker Lake cautiously owing to impact that rapid growth could have on the ability of the local population to provide for itself. It states “We should seek to avoid placing in the traditional communities institutions which contribute to congregation and which may work to the detriment of hunting and trapping on the land. Baker Lake is one of the traditional communities.” ", "Government correspondence throughout 1957 reiterates the need for expanding the education system in the Eastern Arctic, repeatedly pointing out that the construction of an Anglican Hostel at Baker Lake would serve as a regional counterpoint to the Roman Catholic Hostel at Chesterfield Inlet and thereby deflect suggestions of favoritism of one church at the other’s expense.", "A temporary student residence operated at Baker Lake during November 1957. Making reference to the need for a strategy to accommodate local orphans and students who came from homes outside Baker Lake, a Letter from the Welfare Teacher to the Chief of the Education Division states that, “boarding places are very hard to come by as most of the Eskimos who live in the settlement have been made to take old and indigent persons to live with them.” Down the page it states, “I have tried several ways of setting up a hostel and have been able to obtain the use of a three roomed building in good condition which was formerly used by the Catholic Mission which is now housed in a new building. The building which is available for our use is less than fifty yards from the school and I consider it very suitable. The other officials here have been consulted and approve of the project. It is my intention to set up this hostel for six students by January 1st, but to put it into operation when the school opens. I would like your permission to begin on November 2nd.” It concludes, “I have an Eskimo Lady who will cook meals and live with the children and my wife and I will supervise everything.” A post script to the same Letter states “P.S. since I wrote this letter I have received your permission to operate the hostel.”", "A subsequent Memorandum from the Welfare Teacher states that three students “boarded in the temporary hostel from November 2nd to 30th, 1957, this on the authority of your telegram.” It then notes that the temporary hostel would be closed 11/30/1957, and that the hostel pupils would be put into local boarding. Two would live with the Welfare Teacher and the third would board with a local family"],

To rectify this situation plans were made to construct two 8 pupil student hostels, expand the day school facility, and hire at least one more teacher prior to the 1960/61 school year.

It is unlikely that materials will be delivered to the site until August. Completion of the hostels is not expected before October 31.” ", "A Memorandum to the Regional Administrator states that owing to harsh weather conditions at Baker Lake it was unlikely that both hostels would be completed before 1/1/1961. It recommended the completion of one hostel prior to Christmas, to be opened in the new year, and then completing the second in 1962 as the weather became less hostile.", "A Memorandum dated 12/23/1960 states “The Chief Superintendent of Schools in company with the Chief Engineer from the Arctic District Office recently visited the settlement of Baker Lake.

There was a boy in my class (he still has not left the settlement) who is a suspected TB case. If he has TB he should be sent immediately for treatment. As it is he has been left almost 3 months in a crowded house. Looking at this from a purely personal point of view, I object to being needlessly exposed to active TB germs in a crowded classroom. Taking the larger view, I certainly must protest the needless endangering of the whole class – and these, or at least some of them, have a past history of TB.'",
