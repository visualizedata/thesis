The Government would continue the usual school per capita grants for children admitted to the Preventorium, and in addition was prepared to pay an extra 25 cents per day per child during their stay [FAR-002122]. The Preventorium opened in January 1938 and it accommodated approximately 30 children during its operation [FAR-060226; FAR-002140-0001; NPC-500112]. In a January 1939 letter to the Director of Medical Services, DIAND, a doctor from the St. Boniface Sanatorium noted that the original purpose of the Preventorium was to provide generally unwell children a place to be given extra care and medical supervision, and that potentially infectious cases of tuberculosis should not be admitted [FAR-002161-0001]. The doctor expressed concern regarding the recent admission of 'spreader' cases to the Preventorium, as they could possibly contaminate the children at the residential school, with whom they associated freely except in regard to sleeping quarters. If the Preventorium was to be run as a 'spreader school,' the doctor recommended a separate dining room with separate dishes, classroom and playgrounds, and no interaction between Preventorium children and other students at the residential school. The Preventorium at Fort Alexander IRS closed in August 1939 as recommended by officers of the Manitoba Tuberculosis Sanatorium Board, since the institution was not accomplishing the results expected and the health of the children at the residence was potentially at risk [NPC-500112; FAR-060226]. By November 1939, the closed Preventorium was in use as a dormitory for Fort Alexander IRS [FAR-060231]. An October 1946 letter written by the Principal at Fort Alexander IRS describes the former Preventorium building as annexed to the school [FAR-060226].",
