      "notes": "On July 14, 1970, a sit-in protest by parents and other concerned local First Nations' members began at Blue Quills Indian Residential School, beginning with approximately 60 people, and eventually peaking at around 300 people. When Regional Government officials suggested that rather than a direct transfer ofthe school to the Blue Quills Native Education Council that the Council instead form a separate school district under provincial jurisdiction, the meeting broke up, as the First Nations at the protest considered such a transfer oflndian education to the province a violation oftheir treaty rights. The Government officials were asked to leave, and were told that the protesters would occupy Blue Quills until the Minister responsible for Indian .Affairs came to meet with them. The sit-in found support in many First Nations organizations including the National Indian Brotherhood, but not so the religious orders at the school, both the Grey Nuns and the Oblates left the school. On July 27, 1970, the protesters met with the Deputy Minister and other officials from the Government, as well as representatives from First Nations organizations such as: The Voice of Alberta Native Women's Society, the Alberta Metis Association, the Indian Association of Alberta, and the Federation of the Saskatchewan Indians. Progress was made at this meeting and the protesters agreed to meet with Government officials in Ottawa. At these meetings, it was agreed to transfer the operation ofthe school and residence to the BQNEC in 1971, to be supported financially by the federal government. Blue Quills became the first school in Canada to be officially administered and operated by First Nations.",
