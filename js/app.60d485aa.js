a century before the mis-marketing of OxyContin dominated news outlets, the nation faced its first widespread opioid epidemic. The emergence, exploitation, and eruption of both epidemics follow the same arcs in history, yet the de-escalation of the 19th century epidemic has faded into distant memory and recovery from the most recent has yet to be seen. During the first epidemic, pharmaceutical companies and federal regulations laid the groundwork for the stigmatization of opioid addiction that created an isolating environment for those struggling with opioid dependence today. Accessible recovery in conjunction with de-stigmatizing what was left by the earlier epidemic is needed to prevent future devastation and build a system that can prevent history from repeating itself once again. Alleviating future escalation of the modern opioid crisis requires understanding the onset of the first opioid epidemic, sympathizing with the physiology of addiction, and making proven treatments such as MAT, or Medication-Assisted Treatment, widely available. In Crisis, Again visualizes each of these factors necessary for the nationâs recovery and tells the story of opioidâs overwhelming grip on the United States since its inception.","name":"Molly Cook","repo":"https://github.com/m0llyc00k/Thesis-2022","subtitle":"Understanding the Endurance of Opioids & Combatting the Modern American Epidemic","title":"In Crisis, Again","url":"https://m0llyc00k.github.io/Thesis-2022","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Cook.png","video":"MollyCook_2022.mp4","tags":["health","community"],"portfolio":"https://github.com/m0llyc00k/Thesis-2022"},{"description":"Garment lifecycles begin with raw materials and end in a landfill. The process is lengthy and often hidden from consumers. Excess waste and pollution from the fashion industry contributes over 4% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Due to fast fashion increasing in popularity, garments are being created to be disposable. As rate of production increases, the length of time a garment is in use decreases. Sustainable fashion minimizes the negative impact and harm on the environment. If the industry maintains linear production, greenhouse gasses are expected to increase by 50% within the decade. It is crucial to understand and redesign this lifecycle toward a circular economy to minimize waste production. This project shows where clothing comes from by examining the production methods in the fast fashion industry and its effect on the environment.","name":"Juliet Craig","repo":"https://github.com/jcraig13/thesis","subtitle":"Visualizing Garment Lifecycles and its Effects on the Environment","title":"Hanging by a Thread","url":"https://jcraig13.github.io/thesis","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Craig.png","video":"JulietCraig_2022.mp4","tags":["art","fashion"],"portfolio":"https://github.com/jcraig13/thesis"},{"description":"All around the world, countries are witnessing the different effects of climate change. The island nation of Tuvalu, which is home to around 11,000 people, has witnessed sea levels rise by about 0.5 centimeters every year since 1993. The Maldives, a well-known bucket list getaway, is the lowest-lying nation in the world. Therefore, sea-level rise caused by global climate change is an existential threat to the island nation. Finally, Iceland, a cold island nation in the Atlantic ocean actually has the opposite problem. Land in Iceland is rising at a pace of as much as 1.4 inches per year in certain areas as a result of climate change, according to a new study. Like the rest of the world, these countries have much to gain from a better, more sustainable, and climate-friendly world. A main combatant in the fight is sustainable development, which has increased emphasis and interest, both from investors and the public, in sustainable and responsible investments. This study attempts to answer questions about the current state of sustainable development on a global scale. The study, therefore, aims to inform the reader as to how their countryâs standing in sustainable development lies.","name":"GÃ­sli GudjÃ³nsson","repo":"https://github.com/gisligudjons/thesis","subtitle":"Investing in Sustainable Futures","title":"Symbolic Acts for Action","url":"https://gisligudjons.github.io/thesisproject","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Gudjonsson.png","video":"GisliGudjonsson_2022.mp4","tags":["climate","environment"],"portfolio":"https://github.com/gisligudjons/thesis"},{"description":"NYC honorary street names, or co-names enacted by the City Council, can be found above or below the primary street-name signs throughout the five boroughs of NYC. Over the 30 years enactment of this practice documented officially, communities, local activists, and politicians have petitioned more than 2500 honorary street names, to honor people or organizations of special significance to a particular community or neighborhood. Simultaneously, co-names can be seen as an approach to remap the city in a local sense, interweaving its past, present, and future. However, for considerations of legal and bureaucratic costs, honorary street names have never been accessible to the public either through an analog city map or a digital database. How are communities in NYC preserving their heritage through commemorative street naming? And How have co-names entangled with the cultural/political atmosphere? This project surveys the NYC honorary street names, by applying both quantitative and qualitative analysis and data visualization. The source data are collected and parsed from the City Councilâs legislation files, and further aggregated with GIS information and text analysis. As a result, this project transforms the practice of honorary street names into a more accessible format and creates a generated city landscape of memory.","name":"Jiahui(Jessie) Han","repo":"https://github.com/JessieJessJe/thesis","subtitle":"Understanding the Patterns of NYC Honorary Street Naming History","title":"Memories Around the Corner","url":"https://jessiejessje.github.io/nyc-conaming/","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Han.png","video":"Jiahui(Jessie)Han_2022.mp4","tags":["climate","environment"],"portfolio":"https://jessiehanjiahui.com/"},{"description":"Winemakers are some of the most seasoned climate scientists in the world. Agricultural techniques required for harvesting grapes accumulated over centuries, coupled with precise knowledge of environmental patterns surrounding their vineyards, provide them with unrivaled expertise and meticulous methods to optimize wine production. As the most essential ingredient for wine production, climate determines the type and the quality of the wine that can be produced on a particular terrain. Recent extreme weather events have shown that grapes are extremely sensitive to sudden changes in temperature and other climatic fluctuations. Such shifts raise tough questions for the industry whilst disrupting centuries of cultural norms and agricultural practices in winemaking. While the topic of climate change in the wine industry attracts much media and academic attention and generates important discussions within the industry, most of the existing evidence is either geographically localized, confined to a specific grape variety, or difficult to grasp for wine aficionados. The Ripe for Disruption project provides a âglocalâ glimpse into the wine industry, by using geovisualization tools to help readers better grasp which wine regions are already highly exposed to global warming. A closer look at extreme weather events that recently impacted the âOld Worldâ and the âNew Worldâ is provided to contextualize these macro-level shifts, before finally, exploring different opportunities and adaptive changes the wine industry might go through as a result.","name":"Yann Kerblat","repo":"https://github.com/ykerblat/thesis","subtitle":"Climate Change and the Future of the Wine Industry","title":"Ripe for Disruption","url":"https://ykerblat.github.io/thesis","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Kerblat.png","video":"YannKerblat_2022.mp4","tags":["climate","environment"],"portfolio":"https://github.com/ykerblat/thesis"},{"description":"Is Food Making You Sick? is exploring the relationship between diet and health in 184 countries through the analysis and visualization of extensive data on nutritional factors and diseases.

And inversely what does the brain imagine seeing or hearing given certain types of neural responses? These questions have intrigued people for centuries and motivated neuroscientists and philosophers to study the relationship between mind and body in various senses: seeing, hearing, touching, and smelling. Despite all these efforts, the functions of different components in the brain remain mostly a mystery. In Brain Experience, data visualization enables users to experience how human brains perform complicated tasks that appear easy to us. The mechanisms and processes beneath it, surprisingly, are highly complex and involve many organic elements. The project can help the users unravel these beautiful mysteries. We create an educational experience that guides the readers to comprehend the neural processes of the brain performing cognitive tasks such as seeing images or listening to music, and learn about what neuroscientists study. The project first introduces the foundations of the perception process of the brains with visual storytelling and then visualizes the dynamic process of how different brain regions interact to perform these cognitive tasks. Through this journey, readers can better understand how the human brains process information in an organized, systematic and hierarchical way. They will perceive the underlying neural mechanisms behind seemingly daily tasks, arrive at the research frontiers of cognitive and computational neuroscience, and revisit their philosophical stances of life about how our consciousness and thinking processes are formed.","name":"Baihan Lin","repo":"https://github.com/doerlbh/neuroviz","subtitle":"A Journey into the Inner Self of your Perception","title":"Brain Experience","url":"https://howbrain.work/","year":2022,"image":"preview-2022/Lin.png","video":"BaihanLin_2022.mp4","tags":["health","community"],"portfolio":"https://www.baihan.org/"},{"description":"With the increasing wealth of Generation Z and the rapid diversification of entertainment, the blind box industry has made a big splash in the financial market.

The gallery is not built as a participatory environment, but as a space for silent, solo viewing. Beyond the physical design of the gallery, each individual is limited to language as the primary means to communicate their thoughts on a piece of artwork. We cannot see how others see. And as a result, we may not understand how others connect to (or do not connect to) a given piece of artwork. Could showing how someone gazes at art connect us closer to that piece? Could doing so bring us closer to that person, and their perspective in that moment? How We Gaze is a project that visualizes how individuals study art through the use of eye-tracking and web-based data visualization. Within its interface, individuals are invited to view pieces of artwork, and see their gaze visualized alongside othersâ in real-time.

Coupled with NYCâs massive population and intercity transit system, these factors put together have created the conditions for a diverse and interesting population of subway riders in NYC. Many people recognize and appreciate this fact, as there are several extremely popular social media accounts that capture the quirks, beautiful moments, and many inadequacies of the city\'s subway system. While these social media accounts provide a highly subjective and qualitative view of the demographics of the subway system, there have not been many efforts to quantify and visualize these demographics. This is important because these demographics, quirks, and inadequacies of the subway system have their roots in many different factors, including city politics, systemic inequality, and the hyper-capitalistic structure of the city itself. This visualization seeks to present a humanistic perspective of the diversity of the city, from the inside of a subway car.

Information exchange in the contemporary world is constant and new fashion trends or patterns emerge and are influenced by a variety of sources. Fashion change over time cannot be explained by a particular theory, catalyst or cycle. Forecasting future trends is a complex process as drivers of change in fashion culture are vast and patterns in the fashion cycle are difficult to discern. This data visualization explores the popularity of past trends and aims to identify a pattern in a subset of styles that have been recycled throughout the years. Data from the archives of Vogue, a globally celebrated and recognized fashion magazine, is collected over roughly 140 years for a subset of 20 iconic styles. The data visualization synthesizes the number of times a particular style appears in a Vogue magazine edit during a decade and illustrates the popularity of a style during that time period. Research of fashion history and theory as well as social, cultural and technological factors throughout this thesis builds on the visualizationâs trend analysis with the hope of better understanding what drives changes in fashion culture.

But when it comes to Delhi, the capital city of India, it is a point of major concern with studies forecasting speeds of 5 kmph on all major roads in the next five âyearâs. Road density has already reached saturation level and more and more vehicles are added every day on the streets of Delhi. Looking at the severity of the situation, there is less scope for long term planning and what is needed is an exhaustive analysis from multiple perspectives. This project aims to collect and use big data to carry out granular analysis at scale in terms of congestion or excess time faced by different areas and routes. It is both visual and analytical, where the former is carried out using spatial representation that can bring forward unknown relationships. The outcome is a tool that can be used by urban planners and analysts who can combine or filter multiple variables to understand patterns behind congestion across the city.","image":"preview-2017/aseem.png","name":"Aseem Agarwal","portfolio":"https://github.com/agaase","repo":"https://github.com/agaase/msdv-thesis","subtitle":"Congestion on roads in urban cities.","tags":["data","policy"],"title":"How is Delhi Slowing Down?","url":"http://parsons.nyc/thesis-2017/aseemAgarwal/","video":"AseemAgarwal_2017.mp4","year":2017},{"description":"This thesis explores the ways in which green roofs can be used to counteract three major urban ecological challenges in New York City.

Users will then be given opportunities to explore the data themselves and engage with questions regarding the aggregative effects, benefits, and costs of such interventions.

The data collected from the environment triggers a response from the brain to different parts of the body. These physiological and psychological reactions become a unique series of signals and chain reactions controlled by the nervous system. These experiences become memories when data about the event is stored in the human brain. By collecting the environmental stimuli in its entirety, as well as the biometric data created by the electrical and chemical reactions communicating these responses throughout the body from the brain, we are able to evaluate the data without the influence of these filters. Each snapshot of intimate communication within our bodies is documented through the sensor readings of wearable technologies.

In order to follow through the events that took place while I was quarantined at home in the midst of the chaos, I created this visualization that had an hour-by-hour record of the events that happened from the beginning of the violence to the end of the violence. The only consequence I personally faced was not being able to get the Flaminâ Hot Lays I got at my neighborhood market, Jayâs Market, but instead had to go to my dadâs friendâs liquor store. Little did I know that the liquor store stood because my dad among other Koreans living in Los Angeles, acquired rifles and stood guard on the rooftop to deter looters. The lives that were lost in the riots were senseless. The Los Angeles Times gathered data including stories of who each person was and how they lost their lives. A memorial is usually created with the ânameâs of the honorable who died defending our country or in a tragic event that marks history. I created this visualization in order to memorialize the events, as well as the ânameâs of those who died as a means of symbolizing an ongoing tension of power relationships and race relations that still go unresolved. The sense of injustice is what ingnited the city, while little was done to absolve or resolve any of it. Itâs easy to forget this event when everything is seemingly normal today, but there still lies a growing tension that should not be ignored.

The goal is to use this intuition to learn more about different societies via these proxy variables and test if the complexity of each country correlates with its economic outcomes, political system, geographic location, religion, or level of moral freedom. We further employ a clustering algorithm and create a taxonomy that organizes the countries in our world by their shared complexity (heterogeneity vs homogeneity). As a result a new world emerges, one in which our closest neighbors are not the ones sharing our borders but countries located thousands of miles away.

What followed was a flood of stories, building a community of support, natively and primarily through social media. The movement encouraged more women to come forward â not only validating the experience of victims, but exposing more perpetrators beyond Weinstein. But is that all that was said within #metoo? How can we leverage this public platform to take the pulse of the crowd? This project explores the text of tweets in the 6 months following the start of the hashtag, using unsupervised machine learning to derive organic themes.

Researchers in the fields of ecology, conservation biology, and related areas of study are working to better understand species, and the factors contributing to their loss. In generating this knowledge, the scientific community in many ways shapes conservation policy and natural resource management. However, it has been shown that certain species and taxa receive much more attention than those that may be more difficult to access or less beneficial to humans. As a result, species which may be more critical to the overall health of an ecosystem may be at risk. With so much of our conservation practices dependent on the knowledge produced by the scientific community, it is critical to address this taxonomic bias in research. This project offers one solution to the challenge of communicating bias in organismal research. Using the publications from one major scientific journal, the visualization allows the the reader to explore animal species organized taxonomically and by number of publications where the species is mentioned. Readers can explore publications at a species level or use the sorting tools to observe trends.

In practice, the firm quantified that risk largely through the lens of perceived racial desirability. The borders drawn by the HOLC, literal red lines that demarcated neighbourhoods to be starved of investment, still express contemporary inequalities in socioeconomic security. In general, there persists today in America an embedded network of such structural factors, contributing to unequal social outcomes. Compounding the issue of discursively challenging these structures are broad misconceptions on their character and import. However, with issues as directly geospatial as redlining and de jure segregation, there exists an opportunity in visual media to create direct, concise, and easily-interpretable representations of typically oblique content- content that remains both vital to contemporary social welfare, and fundamentally misunderstood by the American layman.","image":"preview-2018/joe.png","name":"Joe Steele","portfolio":"https://github.com/jsteele2003","repo":"https://github.com/jsteele2003/msdv_thesis","subtitle":"In the 1930âs, the Home Ownerâs Loan Corporation was conceived with the singular purpose of providing federal support on mortgage underwriting risk.","tags":["landscapes","pathways"],"title":"Moving the Line","url":"https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2018/joeSteele/redlining/dist","video":"","year":2018},{"description":"The role of flavor perception in modern blueberry breeding","image":"preview-2020/john.png","name":"John Outwater","portfolio":"http://www.johnoutwater.com/","repo":"https://github.com/joutwater/jo_berry_code","subtitle":"Modern blueberry breeding.","tags":["food","culture"],"title":"Sensing Blue","url":"http://parsons.nyc/thesis-2020/johnOutwater/","video":"https://github.com/joutwater/jo_berry_code/blob/master/demo.mp4?raw=true","year":2020},{"description":"Written in the early 1300s, The Divine Comedy stands at the threshold of the Medieval and the Renaissance ages. Both its grand universal scope â Dante travels through the center of earth, up through the planets, and beyond the stars â and the intimate, vivid realism with which Dante portrays the souls he encounters, have captivated readers for seven centuries. In the Renaissance, the specificity of Danteâs geometry led figures such as Botticelli and Galileo to speculate on the exact topology of the Inferno. In the time since, artists from Bosch to Rodin to Twombly have imagined and reimagined the landscapes and populations of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. For poets and writers, the formal complexity, beauty, and radical inventiveness of Danteâs poetry has opened countless pathways for remaking and reconceiving the written word. This project draws inspiration specifically from Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, the great 20th century fabulists, each of whom regarded Dante as a touchstone for the visual and spatial imagination. This project seeks to extend these speculations, inspirations, and reimaginations into the emergent 21st century paradigms of knowledge generation: the three-dimensional interactive capabilities of the graphical user interface, and the n-dimensional dynamics of data transit. Built in JavaScript, using the Threejs 3D library and a MongoDB database, this speculative map of Danteâs poetic space serves as an environment for active, exploratory, deep, and collaborative reading of the poem. My central questions are: How can poetic space be visualized? And how can such a visualization lead us to new modes of reading, understanding, imagination, and expression?","image":"preview-2016/jonathan.png","name":"Jonathan Thirkield","portfolio":"http://www.floatingmedia.com/","repo":"https://github.com/jthirkield/thesis","subtitle":"Written in the early 1300s, The Divine Comedy stands at the threshold of the Medieval and the Renaissance ages.","tags":["arts","leisure"],"title":"Visualizing Poetic Space","url":"https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2016/jonThirkield/","video":"https://github.com/jthirkield/thesis/blob/master/screenpics/DanteInfernoScreenRecording.mov?raw=true","year":2016},{"description":"This thesis attempts to explore the activity of players in a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) by visualizing the interactions they engage in while playing the game and reveal patterns behind them.

What are their usage patterns like and what motivates them to become so invested in these shared virtual environments? Not much is known about the structure and nature of these interactions. Hence, I plan to investigate these interactions through a visualization to better understand the psychology and the patterns behind them. I will be using the shared virtual environment of Aion (an MMORPG released in 2009) as the backdrop for this project. It will be the environment through which these interactions are captured and visualized from. I picked Aion is because it is a highly successful MMORPG that has been around for a long time, and has a large player base. Aion was developed by a Korean gaming company called NCSOFT, and they have gaming servers and offices in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Northern Canadaâs unique geographical and social landscape make its residents especially vulnerable to food insecurity. Extreme temperatures, low population density, isolated communities, inconsistent access, and a higher Aboriginal population set Canadaâs north apart. Declining physical and mental health, the deterioration of Aboriginal traditions, and a degeneration of society are at stake when food insecurity exists. Informed through current studies, reports, initiatives, and data collection, this investigation strives to synthesize the available resources into a single visual representation. The process revealed the inconsistency and lack of granularity within publicly available data related to Northern Canadian food insecurity, as well as the many determinants which intersect to create vulnerability within communities.

Game theory has demonstrated that in these scenarios the most rational choice for the individual is to act selfishly rather than for the collective good. However, when these social dilemmas are played out repeatedly, cooperative behavior can emerge as the more advantageous choice. This project explores three social dilemmas - the most famous being the Prisonerâs Dilemma - and ten different strategies for playing these games repeatedly. We demonstrate how strategies, ranging in character from benevolent cooperators to unscrupulous defectors, can be more successful than others depending on the social dilemma to which they are applied. Furthermore, we aim to discover if certain strategies can elicit cooperation from their peers, thus creating a more trusting and ultimately more successful society.","image":"preview-2018/michal.png","name":"Michal Bacon","portfolio":"https://github.com/mibacon","repo":"https://github.com/visualizedata/socialdilemmas","subtitle":"In game theory, social dilemmas are situations where the interests of the individual stand in direct opposition to the interests of the many.","tags":["competition","play"],"title":"Escaping Social Dilemmas","url":"https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2018/michalBacon","video":"https://github.com/visualizedata/michal-bacon-thesis/tree/master/video","year":2018},{"description":"Throughout history, both the Supreme Court and lower levels of government have played essential roles in determining the extent to which women can legally access contraception and abortion.

This work also aims to serve as a tool for lawmakers to visualize what the consequences of their actions might look like, and help them to preempt decisions that may not be in the best interest of society.","image":"preview-2017/sambhav.png","name":"Sambhav Jain","portfolio":"https://www.sambhav-jain.com/","repo":"https://github.com/jainsambhav91/thesis","subtitle":"A visual exploration of the current sex offender registration.","tags":["data","policy"],"title":"Visualizing Law","url":"http://parsons.nyc/thesis-2017/sambhavJain/","video":"https://github.com/jainsambhav91/thesis/blob/master/work/finalViz/viz2-final2.mp4?raw=true","year":2017},{"description":"Canadaâs Indian Residential School System was a network of boarding schools, industrial schools, and federal hostels created to remove indigenous children from their homes and families. While many schools originated long before Confederation in 1867, the Indian Residential School System was primarily active following the approval of the Indian Act in 1876 â a group of laws aiming to do away with the Indian tribal system and forcibly enfranchise First Nations peoples -- until the the last federally-operated school closed in 1996. Overall, there were 130 schools, as recognized by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and not including various Metis and Inuit institutions, in which roughly 150,000 native children were placed. They were located throughout every Canadian province except Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick. The schools were funded by the Canadian Government and operated by various religious groups. In recent âyearâs and in light of official apologies issued by the Government of Canada, individual provinces and territories, the Vatican, and church groups, information about the schools and their studentsâ welfare has become public knowledge: physical and sexual abuse was common, both between students and involving administrators; malnourishment and poor living conditions were typical; and assimilation, deprivation of cultural traditions, and punishment was the standard. It is estimated that 6000 children died while in attendance. This project aims to investigate the IRS system visually, beginning with the stories of survivors and transitioning into the narrative of each school, itâs student demographics, policies, everyday life, and management.

The practice predates the written word, yet persists to the current digital age. Oral history bridges the gap between what is captured in history books and the individual experience. As oral history has shifted into the digital age, rich debate has ensued surrounding best practices and new questions and issues continue to arise as technologies advance. One of these touch points is on how far oral history can and should stray from its rooting in the oral and aural tradition. This project seeks to explore whether oral history, a fundamentally oral/aural experience, can and should be visualized.

Itâs been used around the world in various forms for decades and has been increasingly popular in the United States in the form of Forest Kindergartens. Forest Kindergarten is a pedagogy rooted in the idea of free-flow learning, nature immersion, and child-led curriculums. Since the introduction of these programs in the United States, those involved have praised the educational, developmental, and physical benefits, with many academic sources conducting research to back them up. Even still, those just learning about the concept have a variety of questions about its efficacy, many that seem to be driven by a sense of bewilderment that a program so different from the traditional structure could possibly lend the same results. This project aims to show how these programs operate in relation to the traditional kindergarten system and how the current public education structure can begin to think about adopting and benefiting from the concepts applied in the nature-based programs. The project itself is broken down into four sections: Origins, Structure, Outcomes, and Implementation.

It should be noted that there are other types of climbing, including: top-rope; ice-climbing; mountaineering and trad climbing; free solo and deep water solo. We will analyze several aspects of climbing, including what the records and benchmarks are for climbing routes, what the various grading systems are (how climbs are measured); what makes a climb hard; how climbers get stronger; and other aspects such as the increase in popularity of the sport over time, and accompanying research and literature.

The first is how unique words are used in each song. This shows how diversely words are adapted to convey meaning. More unique words used in a song create more diversity and more complexity. The approach to measure the level of diversity in vocabulary is achieved by counting the unique instances of words: for example, if a certain word appears more than twice in a song, only the first instance is counted, leaving the duplicates out of the word pool.\\n\\nThe second is how broad the listenersâ vocabulary would have to be. This focuses on how various subjects such as gender fluidity and homosexuality, are dealt with in songs as well as how different topics are interpreted in each song. Today, these new topics require new vocabulary because in the past, they did not exist in the general public sphere. In addition to the quantitative analysis of absolute word count that will be presented in this paper, proportion analysis will also be included : how much percentile is covered by having certain coverage or word. For example, by covering the top 10% of used vocabulary, we can estimate how much percentage of vocabulary is covered in a certain decade.\\n\\nTo analyze trends over time, this project covers hip hop songs from the first advent of it (1980) to the songs of today(up to 2020).

The first is game two from the 1974 Candidates Final in Moscow, which has come to be regarded as a modern classic in tactics, strategy, and chess brilliance. The second is the entire, bizarre 1978 World Chess Championship in the Philippines, which quickly earned notoriety as an example of the type of superstition, paranoia, and scandal commonly observed in chess lore throughout the gameâs rich history. Analyzing chess as a game of fast pattern recognition processes, and slow search processes allows us to see how two fine specimens of Kasparov\'s \\"Drosophila of reasoning\\" became so consumed with fear and loathing in the Philippines, while having delivered a master class only four years prior. This critique is then extended to our own \\"disinformation age.\\" The roles of pattern recognition and time pressure are examined across these very different scenarios with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics, and cognitive psychology. The visualizations that accompany the game analysis are designed to help readers see chess in the same way that a grandmaster does, and in so doing, help them to identify similarities between a grandmasterâs state of mind and their own.\\n\\nWhile reading this bizarre story in todayâs exhausting, 24-hour, 280-character media landscape, it is worth asking: Are we under the same kind of pressure as a chess genius?

It is also the title of a short story by the author Hwang Sun Won, one of the most accomplished writers of short fiction in modern Korea literature. The story which has a simple plot of âa boy in the countryside meets a girl from the cityâ is one of the most well-known short stories of Hwang and has also become an inspiration for animation, film, stage musicals and so on. Through these retold interpretations of Sonagi, the idyllic and natural setting that two young protagonists explore on foot has been visually recreated. This thesis project aims to identify the literary geography of Sonagi and construct a literary map of the story inthe standpoint of data collection and visualization. By doing so, this project provides a spatial and data-based way to explore the text of Sonagi, which may not be obvious when reading text only. Through this endeavor, the project poses and answers a few questions as well: How do readers picture a fictional space when reading literature?; Does uncertainty in text allow room for creative interpretation for the audience?; What role can visualization play in understanding literature? From the original text which is accompanied by English translation, expressions that indicate locations of action, locations recognized by the characters, or locations referred to in the story are collected and used to visualize the map of the fictional space in the story. Some examples of such can be Creek, Stepping Stones, Buckwheat Fields and Mountain.","image":"preview-2021/inhye.png","name":"Inhye Lee","portfolio":"https://github.com/InhyeLee-Data/thesis-2021","repo":"https://github.com/InhyeLee-Data/thesis-2021","subtitle":"A Spatial and Data-based Approach to Exploring the Literary Text","tags":["language","arts"],"title":"Mapping the Literary Geography of Sonagi","url":"https://inhyelee-data.github.io/sonagi/","video":"https://github.com/InhyeLee-Data/thesis-2021/blob/main/demo.mp4?raw=true","year":2021},{"description":"Written English is becoming more readable. If written English as a whole is becoming more readable, why is there an increasing issue with reading comprehension? The author of this paper explores trends in written English and how new digital mediums have changed the way people read. These changes have consequences on reading comprehension that can be counteracted with practices that favor focused reading.","image":"preview-2021/justin.png","name":"Justin Kraus","portfolio":"https://github.com/justinkraus/thesis","repo":"https://github.com/justinkraus/thesis","subtitle":"Written English is Becoming More Readable, Why is Reading Comprehension Falling?","tags":["language","society"],"title":"TL;DR","url":"https://justinkraus.github.io/tldr/","video":"https://github.com/justinkraus/thesis/blob/main/demo.mp4?raw=true","year":2021},{"description":"This project uses machine learning emotion classification processes in order to create emotionally representative data from Project Gutenberg public domain novels. The data is then fitted into a visualization that is further rendered into book covers for the analyzed pieces. Both proprietary and hand crafted APIs are used to analyze emotions found in the corpuses of the 25 high ranking books from Project Gutenberg. Multiple emotion recognition models are evaluated for accuracy and value within the literary space. The machine learning models are then compared to human evaluations of emotions, based on existing psychoanalytic research. Results indicate that machine learning models are able to adequately predict the emotions in novels and generate supporting book cover art.\\n\\n The final outcome of this project will be printable manuscripts with custom generated covers. The visualizations are built using D3js and data storytelling techniques. The charts will be imported into InDesign for final production and typesetting. In order to avoid copyright issues, all books used are in the public domain, with original publish dates between 1800 and 1925. The physical book will contain the text of the original author, as well as accompanying text and diagrams provided from this project.","image":"preview-2021/tiffany.png","name":"Tiffany France","portfolio":"http://tiffanyfrance.com/","repo":"https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/thesis","subtitle":"Generating Book Cover Art Using Emotion Detected Labels in Classical Literature","tags":["arts","language"],"title":"Literary Book Bindings","url":"https://tiffanyfrance.com/ml-books","video":"https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/thesis/blob/main/demo.mp4?raw=true","year":2021}]}')},d950:function(e,t,i){},d97b:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/pj.cc78f791.png"},d9d4:function(e,t,i){},e077:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Kosturska.e048b7e1.png"},e5e3:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Lin.9f77b29e.png"},e658:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/danR.4bc84a3c.png"},e67c:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/candice.dd058617.png"},eb50:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Cook.1975c8c0.png"},ec19:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/amina.5e308da9.png"},f14a:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Lu.290862f3.png"},f245:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/nic.f177d8f8.png"},f284:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/aaditi.8afa4320.png"},f4b9:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/tiffany.e3e25d90.png"},f556:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Zhuravlev.7d4f6f9c.png"},f5f7:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/rik.a63cf994.png"},f87d:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/jaime.7b0fedf8.png"},f911:function(e,t,i){},faff:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/benzamin.77b6b6eb.png"},fe58:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/shaheryar.c895d644.png"},ffcf:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/dallas.8b46a437.png"},ffd1:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/simone.b0fbdbb3.png"}});
