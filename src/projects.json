      "description": "Congestion on roads in urban cities is a common phenomenon and also regarded sometimes as the hallmark of vibrant business districts. But when it comes to Delhi, the capital city of India, it is a point of major concern with studies forecasting speeds of 5 kmph on all major roads in the next five \u201cyear\u201ds. Road density has already reached saturation level and more and more vehicles are added every day on the streets of Delhi. Looking at the severity of the situation, there is less scope for long term planning and what is needed is an exhaustive analysis from multiple perspectives. This project aims to collect and use big data to carry out granular analysis at scale in terms of congestion or excess time faced by different areas and routes. It is both visual and analytical, where the former is carried out using spatial representation that can bring forward unknown relationships. The outcome is a tool that can be used by urban planners and analysts who can combine or filter multiple variables to understand patterns behind congestion across the city.",

Taking the city\u2019s existing infrastructural landscape as the starting point, this thesis moves to identify underutilized spaces where green roofs would be most amenable and beneficial from the perspective of (1) stormwater retention, (2) surface temperature regulation, and (3) biodiversity enhancement. Users will then be given opportunities to explore the data themselves and engage with questions regarding the aggregative effects, benefits, and costs of such interventions. Ultimately the goal of this project is to provide creative ways of interacting with the New York City \u2018building-scape\u2019 in order to foster community engagement and informed decision making for residents and policy-makers alike.",

The data collected from the environment triggers a response from the brain to different parts of the body. These physiological and psychological reactions become a unique series of signals and chain reactions controlled by the nervous system. These experiences become memories when data about the event is stored in the human brain. By collecting the environmental stimuli in its entirety, as well as the biometric data created by the electrical and chemical reactions communicating these responses throughout the body from the brain, we are able to evaluate the data without the influence of these filters. Each snapshot of intimate communication within our bodies is documented through the sensor readings of wearable technologies. These processors present biological data to the subject through the perceptions and realities created by the goals of the companies that produce these technologies. Feelin.it is an opportunity to share and compare this intimate data with others.",

In order to follow through the events that took place while I was quarantined at home in the midst of the chaos, I created this visualization that had an hour-by-hour record of the events that happened from the beginning of the violence to the end of the violence. The only consequence I personally faced was not being able to get the Flamin\u2019 Hot Lays I got at my neighborhood market, Jay\u2019s Market, but instead had to go to my dad\u2019s friend\u2019s liquor store. Little did I know that the liquor store stood because my dad among other Koreans living in Los Angeles, acquired rifles and stood guard on the rooftop to deter looters. The lives that were lost in the riots were senseless. The Los Angeles Times gathered data including stories of who each person was and how they lost their lives. A memorial is usually created with the \u201cname\u201ds of the honorable who died defending our country or in a tragic event that marks history. I created this visualization in order to memorialize the events, as well as the \u201cname\u201ds of those who died as a means of symbolizing an ongoing tension of power relationships and race relations that still go unresolved. The sense of injustice is what ingnited the city, while little was done to absolve or resolve any of it. It\u2019s easy to forget this event when everything is seemingly normal today, but there still lies a growing tension that should not be ignored. With that, this memorial hopes to remind us that we had to go through this tragedy and that we should do a lot more to assure the prevention of another riot like this.",

We intuitively understand that what language we are born speaking, what religion we follow and what color we are, predetermine a very significant part of our lives and who we are. The goal is to use this intuition to learn more about different societies via these proxy variables and test if the complexity of each country correlates with its economic outcomes, political system, geographic location, religion, or level of moral freedom. We further employ a clustering algorithm and create a taxonomy that organizes the countries in our world by their shared complexity (heterogeneity vs homogeneity). As a result a new world emerges, one in which our closest neighbors are not the ones sharing our borders but countries located thousands of miles away. The combined analysis and visualization leads us to the conclusion that there is ultimately more that binds us than divides us.",

What followed was a flood of stories, building a community of support, natively and primarily through social media. The movement encouraged more women to come forward \u2014 not only validating the experience of victims, but exposing more perpetrators beyond Weinstein. But is that all that was said within #metoo? How can we leverage this public platform to take the pulse of the crowd? This project explores the text of tweets in the 6 months following the start of the hashtag, using unsupervised machine learning to derive organic themes. By analyzing the scope of language used in #metoo tweets through k-means cluster analysis, we can uncover hidden themes.

These different agendas need to be aligned with concrete paths for the children and also juxtaposed with their professional and lived experience.

Scholarly articles, grants, and research papers serve as the dominant method of distributing work. This visualization sought to challenge that status quo by creating a digital resource that portrayed data collected by The Group Attachment Based Intervention (GABI) study, a pragmatic clinical trial focused on reducing child maltreatment in vulnerable families. It was developed jointly by The New School for Social Research Center for Attachment and Einstein Albert Einstein College of Medicine\u2019s Center for Babies, Toddlers and Families, in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the United States. The intervention targets vulnerable families at high risk of maltreatment and abuse, specifically working with children ages 0-3. One in four children in the United States experiences child maltreatment at some point in their lives. Among these, one in four victims will be under the age of three. This visualization hopes to shed light on the important work being conducted by this study and provide a unique resource that can better share psychological datasets with all stakeholders involved in the work as well as greater interested audiences.",

As China dredges up \u22483,200 acres of territory ex nihilo in the South China Sea and emplaces sea missiles astride the Philippine archipelago, and as Russia disperses its submarines more widely across the Mediterranean as it conducts simulated attack strafing runs against NATO vessels in the Baltic Sea, the Obama and Trump national security teams have faced increasingly intricate naval diplomacy and maritime security challenges in recent \u201cyear\u201ds. With these shifts in mind, this thesis examines the overall patterns in U.S. naval diplomacy worldwide from 2012 to 2018, querying diplomatic tension in the STRATFOR dataset under both the Obama and Trump administrations and comparing them to vessel movements as well as freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS).

      "description": "World species are declining at relatively high rates. Researchers in the fields of ecology, conservation biology, and related areas of study are working to better understand species, and the factors contributing to their loss. In generating this knowledge, the scientific community in many ways shapes conservation policy and natural resource management. However, it has been shown that certain species and taxa receive much more attention than those that may be more difficult to access or less beneficial to humans. As a result, species which may be more critical to the overall health of an ecosystem may be at risk. With so much of our conservation practices dependent on the knowledge produced by the scientific community, it is critical to address this taxonomic bias in research. This project offers one solution to the challenge of communicating bias in organismal research. Using the publications from one major scientific journal, the visualization allows the the reader to explore animal species organized taxonomically and by number of publications where the species is mentioned. Readers can explore publications at a species level or use the sorting tools to observe trends. This visual investigation aims to provoke the reader into questioning prevailing practices for understanding nature. Using research publications as a lens through which we can explore scientific methods of inquiry, this piece visualizes not only the species which receive the most attention from humans but also those which may be least understood.",

In practice, the firm quantified that risk largely through the lens of perceived racial desirability. The borders drawn by the HOLC, literal red lines that demarcated neighbourhoods to be starved of investment, still express contemporary inequalities in socioeconomic security. In general, there persists today in America an embedded network of such structural factors, contributing to unequal social outcomes. Compounding the issue of discursively challenging these structures are broad misconceptions on their character and import. However, with issues as directly geospatial as redlining and de jure segregation, there exists an opportunity in visual media to create direct, concise, and easily-interpretable representations of typically oblique content- content that remains both vital to contemporary social welfare, and fundamentally misunderstood by the American layman.",

Both its grand universal scope \u2014 Dante travels through the center of earth, up through the planets, and beyond the stars \u2014 and the intimate, vivid realism with which Dante portrays the souls he encounters, have captivated readers for seven centuries. In the Renaissance, the specificity of Dante\u2019s geometry led figures such as Botticelli and Galileo to speculate on the exact topology of the Inferno. In the time since, artists from Bosch to Rodin to Twombly have imagined and reimagined the landscapes and populations of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. For poets and writers, the formal complexity, beauty, and radical inventiveness of Dante\u2019s poetry has opened countless pathways for remaking and reconceiving the written word. This project draws inspiration specifically from Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, the great 20th century fabulists, each of whom regarded Dante as a touchstone for the visual and spatial imagination. This project seeks to extend these speculations, inspirations, and reimaginations into the emergent 21st century paradigms of knowledge generation: the three-dimensional interactive capabilities of the graphical user interface, and the n-dimensional dynamics of data transit. Built in JavaScript, using the Threejs 3D library and a MongoDB database, this speculative map of Dante\u2019s poetic space serves as an environment for active, exploratory, deep, and collaborative reading of the poem. My central questions are: How can poetic space be visualized? And how can such a visualization lead us to new modes of reading, understanding, imagination, and expression?",

What are their usage patterns like and what motivates them to become so invested in these shared virtual environments? Not much is known about the structure and nature of these interactions. Hence, I plan to investigate these interactions through a visualization to better understand the psychology and the patterns behind them. I will be using the shared virtual environment of Aion (an MMORPG released in 2009) as the backdrop for this project. It will be the environment through which these interactions are captured and visualized from. I picked Aion is because it is a highly successful MMORPG that has been around for a long time, and has a large player base. Aion was developed by a Korean gaming company called NCSOFT, and they have gaming servers and offices in Asia, Europe, and North America.

In the United States, a gender gap exists in political leadership. Although women gained the right to vote 97 \u201cyear\u201ds ago, in federal and state politics women hold fewer than 20% of seats in congress (Pew Research Center, 2015). Girls and women are often not viewed in society as strong leaders, not only by boys and men, but equally by women themselves. Society needs to become aware of these false perceptions of female leaders and their negative impact on political representation.

      "description": "Although Canada has no official measure of poverty, food insecurity (the financial and/or physical inability to access adequate food) is present in homes across the country, with a particularly severe prominence in Canada\u2019s Northern territories of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. Northern Canada\u2019s unique geographical and social landscape make its residents especially vulnerable to food insecurity. Extreme temperatures, low population density, isolated communities, inconsistent access, and a higher Aboriginal population set Canada\u2019s north apart. Declining physical and mental health, the deterioration of Aboriginal traditions, and a degeneration of society are at stake when food insecurity exists. Informed through current studies, reports, initiatives, and data collection, this investigation strives to synthesize the available resources into a single visual representation. The process revealed the inconsistency and lack of granularity within publicly available data related to Northern Canadian food insecurity, as well as the many determinants which intersect to create vulnerability within communities. The final visualization breaks down the complexity of the issue into an organized narrative in order to establish a foundational knowledge of Northern Canadian food insecurity.",

The UN has organized several missions in the region in hopes of stabilizing the situation but has often met with limited success. This work will focus on examining what it means when a state is defined by multilateral organizations as being fragile.

Game theory has demonstrated that in these scenarios the most rational choice for the individual is to act selfishly rather than for the collective good. However, when these social dilemmas are played out repeatedly, cooperative behavior can emerge as the more advantageous choice. This project explores three social dilemmas - the most famous being the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma - and ten different strategies for playing these games repeatedly. We demonstrate how strategies, ranging in character from benevolent cooperators to unscrupulous defectors, can be more successful than others depending on the social dilemma to which they are applied. Furthermore, we aim to discover if certain strategies can elicit cooperation from their peers, thus creating a more trusting and ultimately more successful society.",

Using the physical landscape of Manhattan as its backdrop, the wave 9 mobile application guides audiences on a walking tour through a physical model of the solar system that begins at Parsons campus in downtown New York and stretches up Fifth Avenue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the model concludes. Along the way, guided by the applications map, audiences encounter various markers which trigger 3D renderings within the mobile app visualizing the various planets of our solar system using augmented reality technology. The three dimensional renderings set within the recognizable landscape of New York city provides audience with a level of comprehension of size, scale, interplanetary relationship, and solar enormity in a clear, intuitive, and accessible way.",

Tracking this over a span of 100 \u201cyear\u201ds, the visualization consists of a timeline exploring this changing distribution, which is then punctuated by qualitative information about significant events in areas like nutrition research, agricultural technology, trend diets, and official dietary guidelines.

This work also aims to serve as a tool for lawmakers to visualize what the consequences of their actions might look like, and help them to preempt decisions that may not be in the best interest of society.",

      "description": "Canada\u2018s Indian Residential School System was a network of boarding schools, industrial schools, and federal hostels created to remove indigenous children from their homes and families. While many schools originated long before Confederation in 1867, the Indian Residential School System was primarily active following the approval of the Indian Act in 1876 \u2014 a group of laws aiming to do away with the Indian tribal system and forcibly enfranchise First Nations peoples -- until the the last federally-operated school closed in 1996. Overall, there were 130 schools, as recognized by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and not including various Metis and Inuit institutions, in which roughly 150,000 native children were placed. They were located throughout every Canadian province except Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and New Brunswick. The schools were funded by the Canadian Government and operated by various religious groups. In recent \u201cyear\u201ds and in light of official apologies issued by the Government of Canada, individual provinces and territories, the Vatican, and church groups, information about the schools and their students\u2019 welfare has become public knowledge: physical and sexual abuse was common, both between students and involving administrators; malnourishment and poor living conditions were typical; and assimilation, deprivation of cultural traditions, and punishment was the standard. It is estimated that 6000 children died while in attendance. This project aims to investigate the IRS system visually, beginning with the stories of survivors and transitioning into the narrative of each school, it\u2019s student demographics, policies, everyday life, and management. What follows is a selection of survivor stories, as gathered by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission between 2008 and 2015.",

The practice predates the written word, yet persists to the current digital age. Oral history bridges the gap between what is captured in history books and the individual experience. As oral history has shifted into the digital age, rich debate has ensued surrounding best practices and new questions and issues continue to arise as technologies advance. One of these touch points is on how far oral history can and should stray from its rooting in the oral and aural tradition. This project seeks to explore whether oral history, a fundamentally oral/aural experience, can and should be visualized. Partnering with Queens Memory, an oral history program based in the Queens Public Library system of New York City, interview sound files and interview metadata were collected, analyzed and visualized.",

However, retaining K-12 educators has become a significant problem both nationally and locally. This is especially true for the math and science disciplines, which are in need of a diverse workforce for future economic development. This study explores and visualizes concepts of professional identity in math and science education to help educators, administrators, and policy makers create better solutions to retain educators. Using a data set from a science and math teaching fellowship program, this study analyzes and interprets professional identity by examining the written reflections of early and mid-career STEM educators and evaluates the effectiveness of using machine learning (K-means clustering) and data visualization tools as a means to analyze teaching motivation.",

The number are surpassing even post-World War II records, when the world was struggling to come to terms with the most devastating event in history. United Nations defines a refugee as an individual who has been forced to leave their country due to political or religious reasons, or due to threat of war and violence. Among all the forcibly displaced people around the world, one third of them are categorized as refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18. In a world where nearly 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute as a result of armed conflict or persecution, this study aims to visualize a distinct cause-effect view, visualizing how wars and armed conflicts lead to the insurmountable displacement, and how seasonality plays an important role in attempting the deadly journey away from home to find asylum.",

      "description": "This thesis visualizes AI-related patent filings by geographic region in the United States between 2016-2020 to better understand the landscape and asymmetries existing throughout regional clusters.\n\n Inventions are signals from the future, as much as they are from the past. They provide us with a barometer for measuring the patterns of economic activity, policy direction, and competitive moat-building by international companies and governments across the world. These visual explorations will serve to connect policy makers, investors, entrepreneurs and academic commercialization offices with opportunities to make better decisions, bring ideas to market, and grow the economy sustainably within the United States.\n\n Without mentioning the communities affected by the dispersion of AI technologies would be a great disservice. There is an even greater need for accelerating education within underrepresented communities; where patents are not being filed. I argue for an increasing need to create an international definition for AI-assisted inventions, and for the creation of an intellectual property commons, which is funded by corporate profitability of AI technologies in order to address the shorter-term inequalities which will result from the displacement due to skills-bias, and other labor demand asymmetries. Redistribution from gains within the short-term will help buffer the problems created by these technologies. I\u2019m optimistic that the advances created by AI as seen through this patent landscape will be a net positive for more developed countries, and there needs to be a framework established to help developing nations and underrepresented communities to benefit in the long-term as well.",

However, in the context of Asian American cultural identity, the word boba has become so widely used in this community socially. It has become more than a popular connotation of the drink itself. The purpose of this study is to explore and visualize the transition from bubble tea to boba, which includes two main aspects: the reasons for the popularity of boba as a beverage in the United States, and the role of boba as a controversial noun in the discussion of Asian-ness in the Asian American community. It is hoped that through the cultural symbol created by a beverage in this era, it will trigger people to pay attention to and think about the Asian immigrant community.",

      "description": "Outdoor education is not a new concept. It\u2019s been used around the world in various forms for decades and has been increasingly popular in the United States in the form of Forest Kindergartens. Forest Kindergarten is a pedagogy rooted in the idea of free-flow learning, nature immersion, and child-led curriculums. Since the introduction of these programs in the United States, those involved have praised the educational, developmental, and physical benefits, with many academic sources conducting research to back them up. Even still, those just learning about the concept have a variety of questions about its efficacy, many that seem to be driven by a sense of bewilderment that a program so different from the traditional structure could possibly lend the same results. This project aims to show how these programs operate in relation to the traditional kindergarten system and how the current public education structure can begin to think about adopting and benefiting from the concepts applied in the nature-based programs. The project itself is broken down into four sections: Origins, Structure, Outcomes, and Implementation. The end goal is to provide a collection of information about nature-based kindergarten programs to enable audiences in urban, rural, wealthy, and struggling areas to equally learn and benefit from educational developments happening around the country and the world.",

      "description": "As I\u2019ve delved into climbing, both in practice and research, one thing has quickly become apparent: the continuous effort and never-ending endeavour to get stronger. As I began to look into this further, and developed questions about climbing benchmarks around the world, as well as the rate of strength increase of climbers, I focused my research on two questions: have we as climbers gotten stronger over time, or are there more strong climbers (or both)? Our treatment for this thesis will attempt to answer these questions by understanding what strength is in climbing. We will focus on bouldering and sport/lead climbing. It should be noted that there are other types of climbing, including: top-rope; ice-climbing; mountaineering and trad climbing; free solo and deep water solo. We will analyze several aspects of climbing, including what the records and benchmarks are for climbing routes, what the various grading systems are (how climbs are measured); what makes a climb hard; how climbers get stronger; and other aspects such as the increase in popularity of the sport over time, and accompanying research and literature. As we work on answering the aforementioned questions, we will work to expand the reader\u2019s climbing knowledge and vocabulary throughout this essay.",

      "description": "This project specifically focuses on two linguistic characteristics in songs. The first is how unique words are used in each song. This shows how diversely words are adapted to convey meaning. More unique words used in a song create more diversity and more complexity. The approach to measure the level of diversity in vocabulary is achieved by counting the unique instances of words: for example, if a certain word appears more than twice in a song, only the first instance is counted, leaving the duplicates out of the word pool.\n\nThe second is how broad the listeners\u2019 vocabulary would have to be. This focuses on how various subjects such as gender fluidity and homosexuality, are dealt with in songs as well as how different topics are interpreted in each song. Today, these new topics require new vocabulary because in the past, they did not exist in the general public sphere. In addition to the quantitative analysis of absolute word count that will be presented in this paper, proportion analysis will also be included : how much percentile is covered by having certain coverage or word. For example, by covering the top 10% of used vocabulary, we can estimate how much percentage of vocabulary is covered in a certain decade.\n\nTo analyze trends over time, this project covers hip hop songs from the first advent of it (1980) to the songs of today(up to 2020). The user is able to compare the changes by navigating dispersion patterns visually by decade and also to see what is the general pattern of vocabulary by seeing the generative art form of word dispersion.\n\n Since this project shows an aspect of pop culture linguistically, the vinyl player interface is adopted as a visual inspiration. The user can explore the processed information as if one plays with an analog music player.",

      "description": "This project analyzes two remarkably different chess matches played between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi. The first is game two from the 1974 Candidates Final in Moscow, which has come to be regarded as a modern classic in tactics, strategy, and chess brilliance. The second is the entire, bizarre 1978 World Chess Championship in the Philippines, which quickly earned notoriety as an example of the type of superstition, paranoia, and scandal commonly observed in chess lore throughout the game\u2019s rich history. Analyzing chess as a game of fast pattern recognition processes, and slow search processes allows us to see how two fine specimens of Kasparov's \"Drosophila of reasoning\" became so consumed with fear and loathing in the Philippines, while having delivered a master class only four years prior. This critique is then extended to our own \"disinformation age.\" The roles of pattern recognition and time pressure are examined across these very different scenarios with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics, and cognitive psychology. The visualizations that accompany the game analysis are designed to help readers see chess in the same way that a grandmaster does, and in so doing, help them to identify similarities between a grandmaster\u2019s state of mind and their own.\n\nWhile reading this bizarre story in today\u2019s exhausting, 24-hour, 280-character media landscape, it is worth asking: Are we under the same kind of pressure as a chess genius? Is this reasonable? What ways do chess prodigies respond to this pressure and what are the possible outcomes?",

      "description": "The video game industry has undergone a series of changes as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Stress on the supply chains of hardware and software have forced companies to adjust to new working environments within short periods of time. At the same time, people have turned more and more towards games as a form of leisure, entertainment, and human connection. We analyze several economic and human studies data sets collected during the past 2 years in order to visualize the supply, demand, and popularity of games during the pandemic. Our results suggest that despite turbulence in the supply chain, game companies have managed to adequately shift their business models to allow for tremendous growth as other industries have struggled. /nIn this project, the visualizations present how regular production process, total consumer spending, user behavior and gaming community network were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. As we expected, the video game industry has demonstrated with data that it is unshakable in people's minds and will go farther in the future.",

      "description": "Sonagi is a Korean word that means \u201crain shower\u201d. It is also the title of a short story by the author Hwang Sun Won, one of the most accomplished writers of short fiction in modern Korea literature. The story which has a simple plot of \u201ca boy in the countryside meets a girl from the city\u201d is one of the most well-known short stories of Hwang and has also become an inspiration for animation, film, stage musicals and so on. Through these retold interpretations of Sonagi, the idyllic and natural setting that two young protagonists explore on foot has been visually recreated. This thesis project aims to identify the literary geography of Sonagi and construct a literary map of the story inthe standpoint of data collection and visualization. By doing so, this project provides a spatial and data-based way to explore the text of Sonagi, which may not be obvious when reading text only. Through this endeavor, the project poses and answers a few questions as well: How do readers picture a fictional space when reading literature?; Does uncertainty in text allow room for creative interpretation for the audience?; What role can visualization play in understanding literature? From the original text which is accompanied by English translation, expressions that indicate locations of action, locations recognized by the characters, or locations referred to in the story are collected and used to visualize the map of the fictional space in the story. Some examples of such can be Creek, Stepping Stones, Buckwheat Fields and Mountain.",

      "description": "This project uses machine learning emotion classification processes in order to create emotionally representative data from Project Gutenberg public domain novels. The data is then fitted into a visualization that is further rendered into book covers for the analyzed pieces. Both proprietary and hand crafted APIs are used to analyze emotions found in the corpuses of the 25 high ranking books from Project Gutenberg. Multiple emotion recognition models are evaluated for accuracy and value within the literary space. The machine learning models are then compared to human evaluations of emotions, based on existing psychoanalytic research. Results indicate that machine learning models are able to adequately predict the emotions in novels and generate supporting book cover art.\n\n The final outcome of this project will be printable manuscripts with custom generated covers. The visualizations are built using D3js and data storytelling techniques. The charts will be imported into InDesign for final production and typesetting. In order to avoid copyright issues, all books used are in the public domain, with original publish dates between 1800 and 1925. The physical book will contain the text of the original author, as well as accompanying text and diagrams provided from this project.",

A Mosaic was created using the base p5js library in order to realize these goals. Elements of interactivity were introduced so that users can select any of the \u2018small images\u2019 to force a redraw where that image was the \u2018main mosaic image\u2019. This allows individuals to jump through different images of museum items based on their desire to manifest realistic mask mosaics.

The museum's digital archives provided geolocation points and other data for the 656 items found in the interactive map featured here. The visualization at bottom left portions out the collection into a set of common colors, and allows you to explore the material accordingly. This involved creating a node script that analyzed the the text descriptions of each gem and sorting them by key words matched to 20 different color groups. With numerous ways of describing something that is \"yellowish green\", this helped to make the data more accessible while also giving the user a general idea of the over all shape, or in this case, \"color\" of the data. All items link directly to the collection record on the museum's website. This is especially helpful for the many items to which image rights applied. I learned over time that the structure of the Smithsonian's returned API data required a more adaptive approach to the data analysis than the rigid criteria I had begun with. For example, looking for the carat weight value in the same exact location of the data would often return \"null\" values. Generalizing the search queries, in addition to creating a placeholder graphic for items with rights-managed images allowed me to broaden my dataset as much as possible without encountering any \"null\" values or other missing pieces. This was especially important for the map, where the sparseness of the available data could quickly become an issue.",

Quipu (also written Khipu) were an ancient record keeping device created in Central and South America by indigenous Andeans, prior to Spanish colonization. Of the twenty or so in the Smithsonian collection, this was the only one that was also included in the external Khipu Database Project, run by Harvard researcher Gary Urton. This external database allowed me to use the data in an excel format to create the visualization. The aim of the project is exploratory in nature, and hopefully aids in a basic understanding of how these recording devices used knots to keep track of numeric data. Eventually I would love to include more of the qualitative aspects of these devices, such as cord material and color.",

Tracking changes and \u201cevolution\u201d in text documents is important endeavour and one which has many solutions. Computer scientists and programmers, for example, use git to track changes in their codes repositories which are more often than not, entirely text-based. This gives us on opportunity to use the same mechanism for tracking changes the constitution. Git\u2019s version control allows tracking changes in a text document as it evolves; it tracks deletions, additions, and even follows separate silos in which draft is being developed via branches. I use git branches to visualise the changing text: in tree graphs and more specifically a directed acyclic graph . Each node represents a commit, version in time of the text - with major changes, such as an amendment, being developed in a separate branch, and then pushed back into the main branch as a a new commit.",

Then tied the garbage icons floating into the pieces having the keywords. Then created a museum comprised of the \u2018unwanted object\u2019. The collections of the garbage-like objects are like the images collection like above. As the user scrolls, the objects turns into the anonymous squares as the users used to see the pieces. By showing this visual, this project wants to convey the message that the unwanted objects are seen as mere \u2018anonymous\u2019 / \u2018unattended\u2019 objects.

The area of interest has been evolved over time as well. It had been geographically limited at the beginning.

These names were chosen because they were the most popuar names as reported on the Social Security Administration website for last 200 years.

Many of The Met's objects have been presented in Cathedrals, and some even adorned high altars, making many of them central to worship.\n\nI wanted to see if using The Met's digital collection I could present the artwork within a narrative framework, and restore the potential for these items to be used as meditative aids.    The Rosary was the perfect vehicle;  it provides both narrative and a prayer context, and it has been used for centuries, including in our present day.   Many people at least may have heard of a Rosary,  even if they do not fully understand what it is or how it works.
