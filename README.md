### Data

Project data is stored in `@/src/projects.json`. It is imported into the `Body` component.

The projects array follows this template:

```
        {
            "description": "Project description",
            "image": "static/preview-YEAR/<STUDENT NAME>.png",
            "name": "Student Name",
            "portfolio": "<PORTFOLIO LINK>",
            "repo": "<PROJECT REPO>",
            "subtitle": "Project intro text",
            "tags": ["#data", "#technology"],
            "title": "Project title",
            "url": "<PROJECT LINK>",
            "video": "<VIDEO LINK>",
            "year": YYYY
        },
```

### Workflow for contributing to MS Data Visualization repositories

1. Initial setup:

   - [Fork a repository, create a local clone of your fork, and configure Git to sync your fork with the original repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

2. In the local clone of your fork, [create a branch for your edits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
   `git branch mybranch` creates a branch named _mybranch_
   `git checkout mybranch` switches to the branch _mybranch_

   - Do all your work in this branch.
   - [Push your branch](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) to the forked repo early and often.
   - Never work in the `main` branch!
   - gh-pages will publish _directly to the live site_ (it takes about 5 minutes to update)

3. [Pull in changes often from the `upstream main` to keep it synced](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) so that when you prepare your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. Again, never work in the `main` branch!

4. [Merge the fork main into the fork branch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16957483) and, if applicable, [resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/).
   `git merge <branch>` merges the specified branch into the current branch.

5. When you are ready for your contributions to be considered, open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) in GitHub. The Pull Request should be for the up-to-date **branch** of your fork. Prior to submitting the Pull Request, make sure you have:
   - Synced the fork main with the latest version of the upstream main (#3).
   - Merged the fork main to the fork branch and resolved any merge conflicts (#4).

### Deploying

Unbundled code (i.e., what you should use as a starting point) is in the `main` branch. The `gh-pages` branch, which is served to http://visualizedata.github.io/thesis (redirects to https://parsons.nyc/thesis), is a deployed version of the `dist` folder generated by running `npm run build`/`yarn build`. To redeploy code on `gh-pages`, follow instructions at https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#github-pages from the `main` branch.

### Tips

Use [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to log problems and communicate.

Sometimes, you mess up and need to go back to a previous commit. [Use `revert`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-checkout). Do not use `reset`! Here's a helpful [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit).
