"foretold, if you remain untouched by grief,",
"and if you weep not, what can make you weep?",
"'Now they were awake, and the hour drew near",
"at which our food was brought to us.",
"Each of us was troubled by his dream.",
"'Down below I heard them nailing shut",
"the entry to the dreadful tower. I looked",
"my children in the face, without a word.",
"'I was so turned to stone inside I did not weep.",
"But they were weeping, and my little Anselm",
"said: \"You look so strange, father, what's wrong?\"",
"'Even then I shed no tear, and made no answer",
"all that day, and all the night that followed",
"until the next day's sun came forth upon the world.",
"'As soon as some few rays had made their way",
"into the woeful prison, and I discerned",
"four other faces stamped with my expression,",
"'the sorrow of it made me gnaw my hands.",
"And they, imagining I was doing this",
"from hunger, rose at once, saying:",
"'\"Father, we would suffer less",
"if you would feed on us: you clothed us",
"in this wretched flesh -- now strip it off.\"",
"'Then, not to increase their grief, I calmed myself.",
"That day and the next we did not speak a word.",
"O hard earth, why did you not engulf us?",
"'When we had come as far as the fourth day",
"my Gaddo threw himself on the ground before me,",
"crying, \"O father, why won't you help me?\"",
"'There he died; and even as you see me now",
"I watched the other three die, one by one,",
"on the fifth day and the sixth. And I began,",
"'already blind, to grope over their bodies,",
"and for two days called to them, though they were dead.",
"Then fasting had more power than grief.'",
"Having said this, with maddened eyes he seized",
"that wretched skull again between his teeth",
"and clenched them on the bone just like a dog.",
"Ah Pisa, how you shame the people",
"of that fair land where 'sì' is heard!",
"Since your neighbors are so slow to punish you,",
"may the islands of Capraia and Gorgona",
"move in to block the Arno at its mouth",
"and so drown every living soul in you!",
"Even if Count Ugolino bore the name",
"of traitor to your castles, you still",
"should not have put his children to such torture.",
"Their tender years, you modern Thebes,",
"made Uguiccione and Brigata innocent,",
"and the other two this canto names above.",
"We went on farther, to where the ice-crust",
"rudely wraps another sort of souls,",
"their faces not turned down but up.",
"The very weeping there prevents their weeping,",
"for the grief that meets a barrier at the eyelids",
"turns inward to augment their anguish,",
"since their first tears become a crust",
"that like a crystal visor fills",
"the cups beneath the eyebrows.",
"Although the cold had made",
"all feeling leave my face",
"as though it were a callus,",
"I still could feel a breath of wind.",
"And I said: 'Master, who sets this in motion?",
"Are not all winds banished here below?'",
"Thus he to me: 'You will come soon enough",
"to where your eyes will give an answer,",
"seeing the source that puts out such a blast.'",
"And one of the wretches in the icy crust",
"cried out: 'O souls, so hard of heart",
"you are assigned the lowest station,",
"'lift from my face these rigid veils",
"so I can vent a while the grief that swells",
"my heart, until my tears freeze up again.'",
"'If you want my help, let me know your name,'",
"I answered. 'Then, if I do not relieve you,",
"may I have to travel to the bottom of the ice.'",
"He spoke: 'I am Fra Alberigo. I am he",
"who harvested the evil orchard,",
"and here, for figs, I am repaid in dates.'",
"'Oh,' said I to him, 'are you already dead?'",
"And he to me: 'I have no knowledge",
"how my body fares in the world above.",
"'Such privilege has this Ptolomea,",
"that many times a soul may fall down here",
"well before Atropos has cut it loose.",
"'So that you may be all the more inclined",
"to scrape these tear-drops glazed upon my face,",
"know that the moment when a soul betrays",
"'as I did, its body is taken by a devil,",
"who has it then in his control",
"until the time allotted it has run.",
"'The soul falls headlong to this cesspool.",
"Perhaps the body of this shade, who spends",
"the winter with me here, still walks the earth,",
"'as you must know, if you've come down just now.",
"He is Branca d'Oria. Quite some years",
"have passed since he was thus confined.'",
"'I think,' I said to him, 'you're fooling me.",
"For Branca d'Oria is not yet dead: he eats",
"and drinks and sleeps and puts on clothes.'",
"'In the ditch above, of the Malebranche,'",
"he said, 'where the clingy pitch is at the boil,",
"Michel Zanche had not yet arrived",
"'when this man left a devil in his stead",
"to own his body, as did his kinsman,",
"his partner in the treacherous act.",
"'But now extend your hand and open",
"my eyes for me.' I did not open them.",
"And to be rude to him was courtesy.",
"O men of Genoa, race estranged",
"from every virtue, crammed with every vice,",
"why have you not been driven from the earth?",
"With the most heinous spirit of Romagna",
"I found a son of yours who, for his evil deeds,",
"even now in Cocytus bathes his soul",
"while yet his body moves among the living."],
[
"'Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni",
"toward us. Look straight before you",
"and see if you can make him out,' my master said.",
"As when a thick mist rises, or when our hemisphere",
"darkens to night, one may discern",
"a distant windmill by its turning sails,",
"it seemed to me I saw such a contrivance.",
"And, to avoid the wind, I drew in close",
"behind my leader: there was nowhere else to hide.",
"Now -- and I shudder as I write it out in verse --",
"I was where the shades were wholly covered,",
"showing through like bits of straw in glass.",
"Some are lying down, still others stand erect:",
"some with their heads, and some their footsoles, up,",
"some bent like bows, their faces to their toes.",
"When we had gotten far enough along",
"that my master was pleased to let me see",
"the creature who was once so fair of face,",
"he took a step aside, then brought me to a halt:",
"'Look there at Dis! And see the place",
"where you must arm yourself with fortitude.'",
"Then how faint and frozen I became,",
"reader, do not ask, for I do not write it,",
"since any words would fail to be enough.",
"It was not death, nor could one call it life.",
"Imagine, if you have the wit,",
"what I became, deprived of either state.",
"The emperor of the woeful kingdom",
"rose from the ice below his breast,",
"and I in size am closer to a giant",
"than giants are when measured to his arms.",
"Judge, then, what the whole must be",
"that is proportional to such a part.",
"If he was fair as he is hideous now,",
"and raised his brow in scorn of his creator,",
"he is fit to be the source of every sorrow.",
"Oh, what a wonder it appeared to me",
"when I perceived three faces on his head.",
"The first, in front, was red in color.",
"Another two he had, each joined with this,",
"above the midpoint of each shoulder,",
"and all the three united at the crest.",
"The one on the right was a whitish yellow,",
"while the left-hand one was tinted like the people",
"living at the sources of the Nile.",
"Beneath each face two mighty wings emerged,",
"such as befit so vast a bird:",
"I never saw such massive sails at sea.",
"They were featherless and fashioned",
"like a bat's wings. When he flapped them,",
"he sent forth three separate winds,",
"the sources of the ice upon Cocytus.",
"Out of six eyes he wept and his three chins",
"dripped tears and drooled blood-red saliva.",
"With his teeth, just like a hackle",
"pounding flax, he champed a sinner",
"in each mouth, tormenting three at once.",
"For the one in front the gnawing was a trifle",
"to the clawing, for from time to time",
"his back was left with not a shred of skin.",
"'That soul up there who bears the greatest pain,'",
"said the master, 'is Judas Iscariot, who has",
"his head within and outside flails his legs.",
"'As for the other two, whose heads are dangling down,",
"Brutus is hanging from the swarthy snout --",
"see how he writhes and utters not a word! --",
"'and from the other, Cassius, so large of limb.",
"But night is rising in the sky. It is time",
"for us to leave, for we have seen it all.'",
"At his request I clasped him round the neck.",
"When the wings had opened wide enough",
"he chose the proper time and place",
"and took a handhold on those hairy flanks.",
"Then from hank to hank he clambered down",
"between the thick pelt and the crusted ice.",
"When we had come to where the thighbone",
"swivels, at the broad part of the hips,",
"my leader, with much strain of limb and breath,",
"turned his head where Satan had his shanks",
"and clung to the hair like a man who climbed upward,",
"so that I thought we were heading back to Hell.",
"'Hold on tight, for by such rungs as these,'",
"said my master, panting like a man exhausted,",
"'must we take leave of so much evil.'",
"Then out through an opening in the rock he went,",
"setting me down upon its edge to rest.",
"And then, with quick and cautious steps, he joined me.",
"I raised my eyes, thinking I would see",
"Lucifer still the same as I had left him,",
"but saw him with his legs held upward.",
"And if I became confused, let those dull minds",
"who fail to see what point I'd passed",
"comprehend what I felt then.",
"The master said to me: 'Get to your feet,",
"for the way is long and the road not easy,",
"and the sun returns to middle tierce.'",
"It was not the great hall of a palace,",
"where we were, but a natural dungeon,",
"rough underfoot and wanting light.",
"'Master, before I tear myself from this abyss,'",
"I said once I had risen,",
"'say a few words to rid me of my doubt.",
"'Where is the ice? Why is this one fixed now",
"upside down? And how in so few hours",
"has the sun moved from evening into morning?'",
"And he to me: 'You imagine you are still",
"beyond the center, where I grasped the hair",
"of the guilty worm by whom the world is pierced.",
"'So you were, as long as I descended,",
"but, when I turned around, you passed the point",
"to which all weights are drawn from every side.",
"'You are now beneath the hemisphere",
"opposite the one that canopies the landmass --",
"and underneath its zenith that Man was slain",
"'who without sin was born and sinless lived.",
"You have your feet upon a little sphere",
"that forms Judecca's other face.",
"'Here it is morning when it is evening there,",
"and the one whose hair provided us a ladder",
"is fixed exactly as he was before.",
"'It was on this side that he fell from Heaven.",
"And the dry land that used to stand, above,",
"in fear of him immersed itself in water",
"'and fled into our hemisphere. And perhaps",
"to escape from him the land we'll find above",
"created this lacuna when it rushed back up.'",
"As far as one can get from Beelzebub,",
"in the remotest corner of this cavern,",
"there is a place one cannot find by sight,",
"but by the sound of a narrow stream that trickles",
"through a channel it has cut into the rock",
"in its meanderings, making a gentle slope.",
"Into that hidden passage my guide and I",
"entered, to find again the world of light,",
"and, without thinking of a moment's rest,",
"we climbed up, he first and I behind him,",
"far enough to see, through a round opening,",
"a few of those fair things the heavens bear.",
"Then we came forth, to see again the stars."]
